Removing layers need not be irreversable, keep track of them in the root node

importer should keep track of tags added and replaced

The flags stuff, it's not going to work so well. It should work like the argspluplus, with an inheritence stack of mostly independent classes, I think.

How to wrap <use>, <clipPath>? The implementation might be restraining.

SVG spec has a few categories, but MDN might be better
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element#SVG_elements_by_category

Test: copy, EmbedStack, freeze_attrs

decorations might include
  right angle symbol
    works like arc
  perpedicular bars terminating segments
    work like ticks

  text aligned/centered wrt two points, with a perpendicular offset parameter.
  segment labels suggest point labels. got some of those already, shift em over!


Need a way to reference some document-wide options, such as changing colors or linewidths "globally".
