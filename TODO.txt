make inkscape support optional
it's pretty harmless.. add something to the libs to postprocess it out

Limit as many dependencies as possible to lib subpackage

Paths
  delegate the methods through attributes. p=Path(); p.abs.fooCmd() or p.rel.fooCmd()

  horizontal/vertical lines would be easy and Nice To Have
