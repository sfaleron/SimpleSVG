the tag registry would work if the tag parameter had a default.. but it doesn't seem as useful? maybe later.. or a branch? imported elements can just be inserted directly, have the root converted, or convert recursively

make inkscape support optional

triphi has a lot of dependencies the library doesn't use. might have to split? sad!
It's also grown a lot, kinda swamps the rest
not so much, you're thinking of the rollingngon.
was planning to add argsplusplus, but that's only one.. it uses adb, which uses unexpressions. unexpressions is okay, adb might try to get rid of.

Paths.. well, also others? no.
  got some ideas for supporting absolute movements in Paths. Accept None as starting opint, raise ValueError if relative move is attempted without an absolute first. Alternatively, set position to 0,0.

  Methods lookup their path subcmd, have a common backend method that does the call, with either absolute or relative variants. They have the same signatures.

  delegate the methods through attributes. p=Path(); p.abs.fooCmd() or p.rel.fooCmd()

  horizontal/vertical lines would be easy and Nice To Have
