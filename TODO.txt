Wouldn't want to parse xml, whatever for? It wouldn't be so awful to create a structure from already-parsed xml, though!

Removing layers need not be irreversable, keep track of them in the root node

Pass to Element.add() an instance or a class; instances are treated in the usual way. Classes are instantiated and then *args, **kw applied to init()
_post_init() is not called, only one of these is called.

Adding layers ought to not involve the stack?

Elements should be grouped like they are in the spec, rendering and container; "use" does not belong to either, but it is "structural".


Test: copy, EmbedStack, freeze_attrs

decorations might include
  right angle symbol
    works like arc
  perpedicular bars terminating segments
    work like ticks

  text aligned/centered wrt two points, with a perpendicular offset parameter.
  segment labels suggest point labels. got some of those already, shift em over!
