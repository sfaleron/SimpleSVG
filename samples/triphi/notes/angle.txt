It seems that trigonometic numbers have properties consistent with my angle, but this by no means implies that my angle has the property of being a trigonometric number.


Trying to get this inverse sine resolved into some combination of constants..

Starting with
sqrt(3/8) = sqrt(3/4)*sqrt(1/2), these were not helpful:

This started going somewhere, but it ended up being only circular.

This seemed promising, but a brute-force search in one-degree increments from -90-90 in three variables failed to find any solutions.


Maybe useful identity:
sin(15) = (sqrt( 6) - sqrt(2)) /4
        = sqrt(3/8) - sqrt(1/2)/2

Ends up circular. Usually that means additional relationships are needed.


Mathworld to the rescue again?

sin(S2/2)=sqrt((s-a)(s-c)/a/c)
a=1,b=phi,c=sqrt(5/2)+sqrt(1/2)
s = (a+b+c)/2

sin(Q1/2)=sqrt((s-b)(s-c)/b/c)
a=1,b=phi,c=sqrt(2)
s = (a+b+c)/2

square both sides, don't need that radical mucking things up!

sin^2(S2/2) = sin^2(Q1/2) = (4 - sqrt(10))/8

It'd be useful if the RHS was the sine of something

Now we can use half-angle formulae.
sin^2(S2/2) = (1-cos(S2)/2
            = (1-sqrt(5/8))/2

1/2 - sqrt(10/64) = (1-sqrt(5/8))/2

Lovely, but it doesn't help me get S2. Foiled again!
