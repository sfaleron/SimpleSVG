Trying to get this inverse sine resolved into some combination of constants..

Starting with
sqrt(3/8) = sqrt(3/4)*sqrt(1/2), these were not helpful:

This started going somewhere, but it ended up being only circular.

This seemed promising, but a brute-force search in one-degree increments from -90-90 in three variables failed to find any solutions.


Maybe useful identity:
sin(15) = (sqrt( 6) - sqrt(2)) /4
        = sqrt(3/8) - sqrt(1/2)/2

Ends up circular. Usually that means additional relationships are needed.
