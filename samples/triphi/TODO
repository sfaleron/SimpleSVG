The labels on the points have been rotated, gotta update the math document.. hmm, looks like the labels in there are from the web page in spite of saying "source"!

The text needs to get a good check, maybe some clarifications, or maybe 2/3 of it is redundant?

The glyph position.. and size, presumably, is not adjusted for side length but set for side length 400. might be best to scale afterwards? the rest renders fine; scale and position of glyph can be adjusted.

it ought to center on inkscape's page, it's really wonky, not sure what for? firefox? bitmaps?
